  "reasoning": "This job as Senior User Acquisition Manager at Algorithmics Global seems like a potentially good fit for the candidate, especially since the candidate likes Marketing optimization and has experience with conversion rates optimization, tracking and different marketing channels, they also have an analytical mindset and enjoy finding insights from data. \n\nThe role focuses on user acquisition through Facebook/TikTok, which aligns with the candidate's marketing experience. The emphasis on A/B testing, optimizing funnels, and improving traffic quality matches the candidate's enjoyment of these activities. The requirement of working with strict ROAS KPIs also aligns with the candidate's outcome-driven approach. The candidate dislikes repetitive task, but optimizing funnels is not considered to be a repetitive task by him. The autonomy offered and the focus on results also align with the candidate's preferences.\n\nHowever, several factors make it difficult to assess fit without more information: the company size is not clearly indicated, and while Algorithmics is international, the size of the Indonesian operation is not provided. The candidate prefers small to medium-sized companies (20-500 employees).\nAlso, the salary level is not clear and fair pay is important for the candidate.\n\nI will need the candidate's CV to fully check his experience with Facebook/TikTok advertising campaigns.",
