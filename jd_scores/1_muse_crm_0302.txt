        "The job description mentions a focus on CRM strategy and campaign management, while your self-reflection focuses more on product analysis and marketing optimization. Could you elaborate on your CRM experience and how you see it fitting into this role?",
         "You mention a dislike for documentation, however, this job requires you to create briefs for copywriters. Could you specify more what kind of documentation you dislike doing?",
          "You mention that you prefer concrete implementation work rather then strategy discussions, but the job description mentions CRM strategy development. Can you describe your experience in a strategic role in the past?",
        "You mention 'fair compensation' is a must have, could you please describe what are your expectations?"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The job description emphasizes CRM strategy, campaign management, and a high level of experience with CRM tools such as Bloomreach, while the candidate is more oriented toward product analysis and marketing optimization. CRM experience was not explicitly mentioned, also there is a mismatch in terms of preference for strategic discussions, as the candidate dislikes them, while the position requires strategic thinking. Also, the candidate mentioned 'fair compensation' as a 'must have', it is needed to ask the candidate to specify what it means to them.",
