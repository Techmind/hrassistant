It's unclear if it fits within the candidate's preferred size of 20-500 employees.\n    *   It's unclear if the company uses defined product processes.\n    *   The emphasis on 'innovative product ideas' in the requirements suggests a need for strategic thinking, which the candidate dislikes.\n\nTo better assess the fit, I need the candidate's CV to evaluate their experience in mobile product management and their analytical skills.\n\nAdditionally, clarification is needed regarding company size.",
