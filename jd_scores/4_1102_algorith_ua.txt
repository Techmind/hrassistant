  "reasoning": "The job aligns well with the candidate's preference for working on acquisition/onboarding/activation, particularly in a company that has achieved product-market fit. The role focuses on user acquisition through Facebook/TikTok, which fits with the candidate's marketing experience, particularly in conversion rate optimization and working with different channels. The requirement for A/B testing and funnel optimization also aligns with the candidate's skills. The role involves analytical tools and data analysis, playing to the candidate's strength in data analysis skills and finding insights from data. \n\nThe company being an ed-tech company with a global presence may be stimulating for the candidate. The autonomy offered in the role and the flexible schedule also align with the candidate's 'must-haves'. However, it is not directly related to the ideal of ML/AI related startups.\n\nThe lack of salary details and the focus on SEA/LatAm markets, may cause some concern. Also it may be repetitive if the same advertising campagins are running all over the time.",
