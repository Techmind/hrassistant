  "reasoning": "The job description for Senior User Acquisition Manager at Algorithmics Global seems like a moderately good fit for the candidate. It aligns with the candidate's preference for B2C or SME-focused B2B SaaS companies that are post-product-market fit, as Algorithmics is an established ed-tech company. The role focuses on acquisition through Facebook/TikTok, which resonates with the candidate's marketing optimization skills and experience with conversion rate optimization and A/B testing. The job also involves data analysis, which aligns with the candidate's strength in analytical mindset and data analysis skills.\n\nHowever, there are some potential drawbacks. The candidate dislikes repetitive work, and while funnel optimization is acceptable, the job requires continuous testing of landing pages, funnels, and creatives, which might become repetitive. Also, while the candidate is OK with hybrid/remote work, it is not explicitly mentioned as a must-have in the job description.\n\nGiven the good alignment in marketing skills, analytical requirements, and the nature of the company but with potential concerns around repetitive tasks and lack of information about specific compensation, I am giving this a score of 7. I am adding a +1 bonus to the score if the candidate's salary expectations are met (>= 6000 EUR/USD).",
  "score": 7.0
