    "questions": [
        "You mentioned a preference for product/technical product management roles. This role is for CRM Manager, which is more aligned with marketing. Can you tell me more about your interest in this specific type of role?",
        "The job description mentions Bloomreach, CDP, and Mailtrain. Could you please elaborate on your specific experience with these platforms or similar ones?",
        "You mentioned that you prefer more concrete implementation work over abstract strategic discussions. This role includes CRM strategy development. How comfortable are you with this aspect of the job?",
         "You said that you dislike doing presentations. This role involves presenting campaign analysis and results. Could you elaborate on your experience with presenting data and results in a concise way?",
        "The role involves managing projects, including hypothesis testing and task breakdown. Can you describe your experience in these areas?"
     ],
   "reasoning": "The role seems like a potential fit based on some of the candidate's preferences (data driven, outcome-oriented, marketing experience), however,  it seems to focus on marketing. Also, some of the required and day-to-day tasks seems to be contradicting with his preferences (strategy development, CRM focused, presentations, documentation in a form of briefs). Asking clarifying questions to explore more before giving the final score.",
