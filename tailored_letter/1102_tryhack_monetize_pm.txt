Dear TryHackMe Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Monetization Product Manager position. With 5+ years of product management experience in SaaS subscription-based products and a proven track record of driving revenue growth, I am confident I can significantly contribute to TryHackMe's success.

At C Teleport, I implemented solutions that recovered 500K EUR in overdue debts and increased revenue by 1% through a subscription-based model. At Superjob.ru, I led organic user acquisition growth by 25% YoY. I have experience with A/B testing and subscription dynamics.

I am eager to learn more about this opportunity and discuss how my skills and experience can help TryHackMe achieve its revenue goals.

Sincerely,
Ilya Bogunov
