Subject: Head of Growth - Ilya Bogunov

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Head of Product Growth role at Fjor Nutrition, as advertised. With 5+ years of product management experience and a 10+ year background as a developer, I'm confident I can drive substantial growth in C1, ARPU, and LTV.

In my previous role at Superjob.ru, I spearheaded organic user acquisition, resulting in a **25% YoY increase in unique users** (+1-1.5 million/year). At C Teleport, I led the implementation of **debt control dashboards recovering 500k EUR** of overdue debts, and **increased revenue by 1%** by implementing a subscription based revenue model. I also have experience optimizing landing pages to **grow registration by 35%** in Stat4market.

I am proficient in data-driven experimentation, analytics tools (SQL), and have a strong understanding of monetization strategies. I am eager to leverage my skills to drive growth for Fjor's Keto Diet App and Formula.care.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to discussing my qualifications further.

Sincerely,

Ilya Bogunov
