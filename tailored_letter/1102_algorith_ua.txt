Dear Algorithmics Global Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior User Acquisition Manager position. With my experience driving user acquisition through data-driven strategies, I am confident I can help Algorithmics Global achieve its growth objectives in the Indonesian market.

In my previous role as Product Manager at Superjob.ru, I achieved a 25% YoY increase in new users, scaling user base from 5 million to 7.5 million monthly. At SpacePush/Clickscloud, I increased revenue from the test inventory by 2.5x.

I am eager to apply my skills in campaign optimization and A/B testing to meet and exceed your ROAS targets on Facebook/TikTok.

Sincerely,

Ilya Bogunov
