Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Lead Product Manager - Engagement position at JustPlay. With 5+ years of product management experience in the mobile industry and a proven track record of driving user engagement and retention, I am confident I can make a significant contribution to your team.

In my previous role, I boosted organic user acquisition by 25% YoY (+1-1.5 mln unique users/year) and elevated conversion rates by 20-30% through data-driven experiments. I also implemented debt control dashboards resulting in the recovery of 500K $/EUR of overdue debts.

I am eager to leverage my skills and experience to drive player excitement and long-term retention within JustPlay's rewarded gaming ecosystem.

Sincerely,

Ilya Bogunov
