Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Product Manager (Public Web) position at Bitsgap. With 5 years of product management experience in B2C/B2B SaaS, and a background in development, I am confident I have the skills to drive growth for Bitsgap's website.

In my previous role I increased registrations by 35% by optimizing landing pages and adding new services based on keyword analysis and conversion data analysis. I also led to a 25% growth of new users YoY (from ~5 million unique visitors/month into ~7.5 million/month). 

I am eager to bring my expertise in website optimization, content management, and traffic generation to Bitsgap. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Ilya Bogunov
