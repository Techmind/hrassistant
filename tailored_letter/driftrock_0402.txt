Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Product Manager position. With 5+ years of product management experience in B2B SaaS environments and a strong technical background, I am confident I possess the skills and experience you are seeking.

In my previous role, I implemented debt control dashboards resulting in the recovery of 500K $/EUR of overdue debts, increased registrations by 35%, and I led to 25% growth of new users YoY.

I am eager to learn more about this opportunity and discuss how I can contribute to your team.

Sincerely,
Ilya Bogunov
