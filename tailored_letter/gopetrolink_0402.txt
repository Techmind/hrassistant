Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Product Manager position at GoPetrolink. With 5 years of experience in product management and a strong background in B2B/B2C software development, I am confident I can significantly contribute to your team.

In my previous role as Product Manager at C Teleport, I successfully implemented debt control dashboards, recovering 500K EUR of overdue debts. Additionally, at Superjob.ru, I led organic user acquisition efforts, resulting in a 25% YoY growth (+1-1.5 million users/year). I am adept at defining product strategies, conducting market research, and leading cross-functional teams to deliver successful products.

I am eager to learn more about this opportunity and discuss how my skills and experience can benefit GoPetrolink.

Sincerely,
Ilya Bogunov
