Dear Tiny Boom Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Product Manager position at Tiny Boom. With 5 years of Product Management experience and a proven track record of driving growth in mobile applications, I am confident I possess the skills and experience to excel in this role.

At Superjob.ru, I boosted organic user acquisition by 25% YoY (+1-1.5 million users/year) through data-driven strategies. Also I successfully implemented debt control dashboards at C Teleport, resulting in the recovery of 500K $/EUR of overdue debts.

I am eager to contribute my expertise in mobile app market trends, monetization, and A/B testing to Tiny Boom's innovative products.

Sincerely,

Ilya Bogunov
