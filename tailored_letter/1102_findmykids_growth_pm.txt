Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Growth Product Manager position at Findmykids. With 5 years of B2C product management experience, exceeding the requirements of the job, I am confident I can drive monetization within your MAU.

At Superjob.ru, I led organic user acquisition growth by 25% YoY (+1-1.5 million users/year) through data-driven experiments and UX improvements. At C Teleport I added a subscription-based revenue model, increasing revenue by +1%. I am skilled in A/B testing, data analysis, and optimizing user experiences, making me well-suited to analyze competitor strategies and make data-informed decisions to help Findmykids become the #1 Family Tracker globally.

I am eager to contribute to your team's success. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Ilya Bogunov
