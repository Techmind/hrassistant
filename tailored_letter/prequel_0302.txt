Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Product Manager - Esti position. With 5 years of mobile app product management experience and a background in both B2C and B2B.

In my previous role, I have consistently improved key metrics such as conversion rates (2-3x increase) and user acquisition (25% YoY growth). I am proficient in data-driven decision-making, A/B testing, and optimizing user funnels. I also lead successful integrations with partners, resulting in +11% growth in unique users.

I am eager to bring my experience in monetization, user retention, and technical understanding to drive revenue and MAU growth for Esti. I am ready to discuss my ideas for increasing conversion and retention.

Sincerely,

Ilya Bogunov
