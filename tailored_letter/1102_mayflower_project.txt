Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Project Manager position. With 5 years of Product Management experience and a 10+ year developer background, I have a proven ability to manage projects from start to finish and achieve goals.

In my previous role, I implemented debt control dashboards, resulting in the recovery of 500K $/EUR of overdue debts. At Superjob.ru, I led to a 25% growth of new users YoY and grew user acquisition by 11% through search engine feed integrations.

I am proficient in Agile, Scrum, Kanban, Jira, and possess strong communication skills. I am confident that my experience aligns with the requirements of this role.

Sincerely,
Ilya Bogunov
