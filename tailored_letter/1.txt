Dear Intellya Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Product Owner position at Intellya. With 5 years of product management experience and a background in B2B software development, I am confident I can contribute to your AI-based product portfolio.

In my previous role, I implemented debt control dashboards that recovered $500K EUR in overdue debts and increased user acquisition by 25% YoY. I'm proficient in data analysis, backlog management, and stakeholder engagement. I am also certified in Generative AI and product management.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Ilya Bogunov
