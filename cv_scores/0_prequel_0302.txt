  "reasoning": "The CV shows a strong background in product management with 5 years of experience and 10+ years of development background, aligning with the job requirements. The candidate demonstrates skills in improving conversion rates, user acquisition, and implementing new features, which are key responsibilities for the role. They also have experience with A/B testing, data analysis, and working with various analytics tools mentioned in the JD. They have experience in B2B and B2C and worked with various industries, including ad-tech and HR-tech. The candidate has a good history of increasing user metrics and optimizing product performance. They have experience in the areas of tech and product management, showing a level of technical depth. They also demonstrate experience in fast-growing startups, stakeholder management and team leading skills. \n\nHowever, the CV lacks specific experience in the photo-video industry, which is listed as a desired skill in the JD. While they have experience in user acquisition, and improving conversion for products and services, itâ€™s hard to correlate this experience specifically to the photo/video industry mentioned in the JD, leading to a slightly lower score in this category. Also they have no mention of P&L responsibilities, so this also reduced a related score. Also the lack of concrete ideas to address increasing conversion and retention for the photo-video app, also lowers the specific score for those two.\n\nThe candidate has some experience with AI/ML-related tools, but not a specific track record of using them in their previous roles. \n\nThe overall score is calculated as the average of sub-scores for each matching criteria, as requested. \n\nSubscores:\n- Mobile App Product Management Experience (5+ years): 10\n- Monetization, PnL, Retention: 4\n- Mobile Technologies, AI/ML: 6\n- Data-Driven Decisions, A/B Testing: 9\n- Fast-Growing Startups: 8\n- Photo-Video Industry Experience: 2\n- Ideas for Conversion/Retention: 5\n- Experiment Examples: 7\n- Roadmap Change: 7\n- Team Development/Self-Education: 8\n- Metrics Achieved: 9\n- Vision for Photo/Video AI: 5",
