  "reasoning": "Here's a breakdown of the CV's alignment with the Senior Product Manager - Esti role:\n\n*   **Experience:**\n    *   The JD requires 5+ years in product management for mobile apps. The candidate has 5 years explicitly as a product manager, however candidate points out 10+ years developer background, it might be benefitial. (Score: 7/10. Good, but could be stronger with more explicit mobile app PM experience).\n*   **Monetization & Retention:**\n    *   The JD emphasizes deep understanding of monetization, P&L, and improving both monetization and user retention. The CV provides examples of increasing revenue through subscriptions (+1% at C Teleport), improving LTV, and optimizing ad spending. Mentions boosting organic user acquisition (+25% YoY at Superjob.ru). This aligns well. (Score: 8/10. Solid examples provided).\n*   **Mobile Technologies & AI/ML:**\n    *   The JD mentions expertise in mobile technologies and AI/ML trends. The CV lists \"AI\", \"Machine Learning (ML)\", \"NLP\", and \"LLM\" under skills. However, there's no concrete example of implementing AI/ML features in previous roles. (Score: 5/10. Lists skills, but lacks demonstrated experience in the work history).\n*   **Data-Driven Decisions:**\n    *   The JD requires the ability to work with data, conduct experiments, and make data-driven decisions. The CV demonstrates this throughout the work experience with A/B testing, optimizing landing pages based on data, using multi-armed bandit testing, and building Amplitude dashboards. (Score: 9/10. Strong evidence of data-driven decision making).\n*   **Startup Experience:**\n    *   The JD mentions experience in fast-growing startups. The CV includes experience at several startups (Stat4market, SpacePush/Clickscloud, Revenviews, SmarterQueue), indicating relevant experience. (Score: 8/10. Matches well.)\n*   **Photo/Video Industry Interest:**\n    *   The JD expresses interest in the photo/video industry. The CV doesn't explicitly mention experience or interest in this specific domain. (Score: 2/10. Weak match, no relevant information).\n*   **App Store Launch:**\n    *   The JD requires launching products into the top categories of the App Store. While the CV showcases launching and growing user bases, it does not explicitly say that candidate launched products in the top categories of App Store. (Score: 5/10. Lacking evidence)",
