{
  "reasoning": "The CV demonstrates a strong background in product management, particularly in areas relevant to engagement and retention, but lacks specific examples directly tied to gaming or loyalty platforms as desired in the job description.\n\n*   **Experience:** The candidate has 5 years of product management experience, exceeding the minimum requirement of 4 years. The experience spans both B2C and B2B, which is beneficial, and includes roles at companies like C Teleport and Superjob.ru. However, the experience at Superjob.ru (HR-Tech) is the most relevant, particularly the growth in organic user acquisition.\n*   **Engagement & Retention:** The CV highlights improvements in conversion rates, user acquisition, and retention, demonstrating a data-driven approach. Specific examples include increasing registrations, improving first-session time, and optimizing landing pages. However, there are fewer examples directly related to \"gamification techniques\" or \"LiveOps strategies\".\n*   **Data-Driven Mindset:** The CV emphasizes A/B testing, data analysis, and the use of tools like Google Analytics and Amplitude, indicating a strong data-driven approach.\n*   **Communication & Collaboration:** The CV showcases experience in stakeholder management and cross-functional coordination, implying good communication skills.\n*   **Industry Experience:** While the candidate has experience in B2C and SaaS, the lack of direct experience in mobile gaming or loyalty platforms is a notable gap. The ad-tech experience at SpacePush/Clickscloud is somewhat relevant but not a direct match.\n\n**Scores Breakdown:**\n\n*   **Years of Experience:** 9/10 (Exceeds minimum requirement, broad PM experience)\n*   **Mobile Industry, Retention and engagement focus:** 6/10 (experience, but not in gaming/loyalty. Some engagement and retention projects)\n*   **Data-driven mindset:** 9/10 (Strong emphasis on A/B testing and analytics)\n*   **Communication and Collaboration:** 8/10 (Inferred from stakeholder management and project leadership)\n",
