The JD is for a Lead Product Manager role focused on transitioning B2B products to an AI-driven workflow automation product, specifically for PDF.net and Contracts.net. The ideal candidate has experience with B2B document workflow products, AI, and a data-driven approach.\n\n*   **Experience in AI-driven B2B document management workflow automation companies (Score: 7/10):** The CV mentions experience in B2B SaaS platforms, including travel (C Teleport) and marketplace analytics (Stat4market). While there's no explicit mention of AI-driven document workflow automation, the candidate has a certificate 'Generative Al for Product Managers'. Also, the skills section list 'AI' and 'LLM' as a skill. This aspect is partially fulfilled. Previous roles in ad-tech and HR-tech are relevant but not directly aligned with document management. Recent AI certificate shows potential.\n*   **Expertise in building and managing B2B document workflow products (Score: 4/10):** The CV lacks explicit examples of building and managing B2B document workflow products. The experience is more general B2B SaaS product management, not focused on document workflows. While C Teleport involves some workflow aspects (billing, payments), it's not document-centric.\n*   **Experience in launching and leading SaaS/B2B document management and AI workflow automation products (Score: 3/10):** The CV doesn't showcase experience in launching document management or AI workflow automation products. Previous roles showcase experience in different SaaS businesses but not in document management field.\n*   **Strong analytical skills and data-driven approach (Score: 9/10):** The CV highlights numerous instances of using data-driven experiments to improve conversion rates, user acquisition, and platform engagement. Examples include optimizing landing pages, implementing debt control dashboards, and using A/B testing.
