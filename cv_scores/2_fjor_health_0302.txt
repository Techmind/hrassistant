  "reasoning": "Here's a breakdown of the candidate's CV score against the job description requirements:\n\n**1. Growth Leadership (5+ years experience, track record of improving C1, ARPU, LTV):**\n*   **Score: 7/10**\n*   **Details:** The candidate has 5 years of product manager experience, but this is across a variety of product types, not specifically within the growth/monetization area. Candidate has experience improving key metrics (conversion, LTV), but the scale of achievements and direct relation to monetization are not strongly evidenced for all roles, more like isolated projects. While there is a mention of  \"increased revenue by +1% by adding a subscription-based revenue model to increase the LTV of low-usage customers\" there's a lack of deeper dive in monetization strategies.\n\n**2. Monetization Expertise (optimizing funnels, high-impact tactics):**\n*   **Score: 6/10**\n*   **Details:** There are examples of optimizing landing pages, improving registration/conversion rates, however the CV lacks evidence of experience in different types of monetization models. There is evidence of subscription model implementation and experiments but more is needed to give a higher score. Also, optimizing funnels and running high impact revenue generation tactics is something that needs to be more detailed (what tactics were used and what type of revenue was generated).\n\n**3. Data-Driven Skills (SQL, Amplitude, Metabase):**\n*   **Score: 8/10**\n*   **Details:** The candidate shows proficiency in data analysis, A/B testing, and using tools like Amplitude, Hotjar (which is similar to Metabase) but SQL is just mentioned among skills and is not backed by proven use cases. There is mention of building dashboards with Amplitude so the candidate is familiar with such type of tools.\n\n**4. Team Leadership (building and leading high-performing teams):**\n*   **Score: 4/10**\n*   **Details:** The CV mentions team lead roles in two positions, however, there's no focus on building and leading product teams but more on infrastructure or development teams. There are no specific achievements or accomplishments tied to building high-performing teams and specifically product growth teams.\n\n**5. Hands-On Execution (willing to contribute as an individual contributor):**\n*   **Score: 9/10**\n*   **Details:** Throughout the resume there's a focus on hands-on contributions to the products. It is clear that candidate is willing to contribute as an individual contributor. The variety of skills points to ability to be hands-on in different areas of the product.\n\n**6. Collaboration and Communication (cross-functional alignment):**\n*   **Score: 7/10**\n*   **Details:** The candidate mentions working with cross-functional teams, but there are no specific examples of collaboration or cross-functional alignment and the results of such alignment. It's stated that stakeholder's expectations were managed, so there is experience of communicating with other teams.\n\n**7. Ownership and Proactivity (delivering impactful results):**\n*   **Score: 9/10**\n*   **Details:** The CV shows a track record of ownership and delivering results, with the variety of different product improvements described.\n\n**8. AI Tools and Automation (ChatGPT, MidJourney, AI data analysis):**\n*   **Score: 5/10**\n*   **Details:**  The candidate mentioned general skills of AI and ML and mentions completion of  \"Generative Al for Product Managers â€“ Mini Simulator\" course, but there are no specific examples of utilizing AI tools or any automation tools in the past projects. There is a mention of  usage of \"Multi armed bandit\" type of testing, but it is not stated that it was a ML or AI powered solution.\n\n**9. English Proficiency (C1 level or higher):**\n*   **Score: 10/10**\n*   **Details:** The CV is written in perfect English with proper use of business vocabulary, indicating a very good command of the language, likely C1 or higher.\n\n**General Score Calculation:**\nGeneral Score = (7 + 6 + 8 + 4 + 9 + 7 + 9 + 5 + 10) / 9 = 65/9 =  **7.22**\n",
