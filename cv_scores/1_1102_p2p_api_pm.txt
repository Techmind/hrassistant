  "reasoning": "Here's a breakdown of the CV's suitability for the Product Manager (API) role at P2P.org:\n\n*   **Proven Experience in Large-Scale API Development and Optimization (Requirement Score: 7/10):** The CV mentions experience with REST APIs through integrations and describes optimizing ad-bidders. However, it lacks specific details of *designing* API products from the ground up. There's no mention of managing complex API systems specifically for B2B use cases, though C Teleport role suggests some B2B SaaS experience which is a partial match.\n\n*   **Deep Understanding of API Performance, Reliability, and Scalability (Requirement Score: 6/10):** While the CV showcases data-driven decision-making, performance monitoring, and optimization, it lacks explicit examples related to API performance metrics, reliability strategies, and scalability solutions. The mention of 'scalable platform components' at Badoo is relevant but not deeply detailed in API context.\n\n*   **Familiarity with API-Related Best Practices (Versioning, Security, Integration) and Technical Knowledge of REST API Architecture (Requirement Score: 5/10):** The CV demonstrates some familiarity with API integrations (search engine feed integrations) and mentions REST APIs. However, it's missing specifics on API versioning strategies, security protocols implemented, or deep-dives into REST API architectural decisions. The CV also omits mentioning the authentication mechanisms.\n\n*   **Crypto Experience (Must-Have): Familiarity with Blockchain Technologies, Particularly Ethereum (Requirement Score: 3/10):** The CV doesn't explicitly mention experience with blockchain technologies or Ethereum. This is a critical gap, as crypto experience is listed as a *must-have*.\n\n*   **Experience with Ethereum Staking and Restaking Solutions (Significant Plus) (Requirement Score: 1/10):** The CV contains no indication of experience with Ethereum staking or restaking solutions.\n\n*   **Fluent English (Requirement Score: 10/10):**  The CV is well-written and grammatically correct, demonstrating fluency in English.\n\n**General Score Calculation:**\n\n(7 + 6 + 5 + 3 + 1 + 10) / 6 = 5.33\n",
