  "reasoning": "Here's a breakdown of the CV's score based on the job description:\n\n*   **Experience (8/10):** The candidate has 5 years of Product Management experience, exceeding the minimum requirement of 4 years. The experience spans both B2C and B2B environments, which is a plus. The CV highlights experience in improving conversion rates, user acquisition, and implementing debt control dashboards.

A slight deduction due to the absence of direct engagement experience.\n*   **Data-Driven Mindset & Analytical Skills (9/10):** The CV clearly showcases a data-driven approach with examples of designing A/B tests, using data to optimize landing pages, and improving user onboarding based on data analysis. The candidate mentions using tools like Hotjar, Amplitude, and Google Analytics, indicating strong analytical skills. \n*   **Project Management Skills (7/10):** The CV provides examples of managing projects, such as leading partner integrations, implementing new services, and driving UX improvements. However, more details on specific project management methodologies used would strengthen this area.\n*   **Communication Skills (8/10):** The CV is well-written and presents information clearly. The candidate lists English as a skill, which is beneficial for cross-team collaboration.\n*   **Engagement & Retention (6/10):** While the candidate demonstrates general experience in product management and user acquisition, direct experience in driving engagement and retention within the context of a rewarded gaming ecosystem is not explicitly clear in the CV.
