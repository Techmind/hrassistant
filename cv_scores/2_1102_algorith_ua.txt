  "reasoning": "The candidate has a strong background in product management, with experience in B2C and B2B software development. However, the CV lacks direct experience in user acquisition (UA) using Facebook/TikTok, specifically within the children's education segment or SEA/LatAm markets. While the candidate demonstrates skills in A/B testing, data analysis, and conversion optimization, which are relevant to UA, there is no concrete evidence of managing advertising budgets of over $50K or achieving ROAS of 2.5-3x on Facebook/TikTok. The candidate's experience in organic user acquisition is valuable, but the role requires expertise in paid UA channels.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the scoring:\n\n*   **Experience with Facebook/TikTok in SEA/LatAm or children's edtech:** 1/10 (Very limited direct experience)\n*   **Experience managing $50K+ ad budgets:** 2/10 (No explicit mention, inferred from product management roles)\n*   **Understanding unit economics and ROAS KPIs:** 6/10 (Implied through data analysis and conversion optimization experience)\n*   **A/B testing and data-driven decision making:** 8/10 (Strong evidence of these skills)\n*   **Problem-solving and independence:** 7/10 (Demonstrated through various project leadership roles)\n*   **English proficiency:** 10/10 (Assuming B2 or higher based on international experience)",
