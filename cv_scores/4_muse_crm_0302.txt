  "reasoning": "Based on the job description and the provided CV, here's a breakdown of the scoring:\n\n*   **CRM Marketing Experience (3+ years):** The candidate has 5 years as Product Manager and 10+ years of developer background. However, their experience in pure CRM is less explicit. While they've managed products that touch on user acquisition, onboarding, and conversion optimization, it's not directly CRM marketing. Their experience at SpacePush/Clickscloud and SmarterQueue involved aspects of ad tech and SMM, which are related but not core CRM. The CV showcases roles involving user engagement and feature implementation (e.g., SmarterQueue), indicating experience impacting customer journeys, but again, not explicitly CRM-focused. I will estimate the years of experience with CRM marketing to be about 2 years so the score for this section will be 6.\n*   **Familiarity with Push Notifications, In-App Alerts, and Inbox Messages:** The candidate's experience at SpacePush/Clickscloud and SmarterQueue suggests some familiarity with push notifications and messaging strategies. The CV mentions optimizing ad bidders and UX, as well as implementing features like RSS imports and video uploads. The experience at Superjob with increasing registrations and conversion rates also suggests a good grasp of user engagement strategies. So the score for this section will be 7.\n*   **Building Trigger Chains and Segmenting Databases:** The CV mentions working with marketing tools to grow registrations, optimizing landing pages, and redesigning menus based on user behavior analysis. The experience at Superjob involved UX improvements to improve target actions (registration/job responses), implying database segmentation and triggered actions. So the score for this section will be 6.\n*   **Experience with CDP (preferably Bloomreach):** The CV does not explicitly mention Bloomreach. So the score for this section will be 2.\n*   **Hypothesis Testing and Project Management:** The CV has a lot of experience in hypothesis testing and project management (mentioning managing projects from the ground up at multiple companies. They also mention A/B testing at multiple places. So the score for this section will be 9.\n*   **English Language Proficiency:** The CV doesn't explicitly state Upper-Intermediate or higher, but the resume is written to a high level. The candidate has worked with companies from Netherlands, USA, Israel and etc. I will assume their English level proficiency is high, so the score for this section will be 9.",
