  "reasoning": "The candidate's CV showcases extensive experience as a Product Manager, with a strong focus on data-driven decision-making and optimization. However, there are significant gaps in the specific requirements outlined in the job description. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n*   **Relevant Experience (Facebook/TikTok in SEA or children's edtech):** 1/10\n    *   The CV lacks any mention of direct experience managing advertising campaigns on Facebook/TikTok, especially in the SEA region or within the children's edtech sector. This is a critical requirement, and its absence significantly impacts the score.\n*   **Budget Management ($50K+):** 2/10\n    *   While the CV mentions increasing revenue and optimizing ad spending, it does not explicitly state experience managing advertising budgets of $50K or more on Facebook/TikTok. The candidate managed budgets but for diffrent channels.\n*   **ROAS Understanding:** 4/10\n    *   The CV demonstrates an understanding of unit economics and conversion optimization, which are related to ROAS. However, there's no direct evidence of managing campaigns with a specific ROAS target of 2.5-3x. Need to make assumptions.\n*   **Creative Process:** 1/10\n    *   The CV doesn't detail experience in creating creatives (scripts, ideas, references, casting, editing) for advertising campaigns. Need to make assumptions that candidate coordinated work with design teams to build creatives but that will not be direct experience.\n*   **Campaign Optimization:** 7/10\n    *   The candidate has experience in A/B testing, optimizing landing pages, and improving user acquisition funnels. These skills are relevant to campaign optimization, but the CV lacks specific examples related to Facebook/TikTok.\n*   **Analytical Skills:** 8/10\n    *   The CV strongly highlights the candidate's analytical skills, including interpreting data, drawing conclusions from experiments, and using data to drive product decisions. This is a definite strength.\n*   **Problem Solving & Independence:** 7/10\n    *   The CV demonstrates the ability to independently solve problems and drive results in various product roles. This is a valuable skill, although not specific to UA management.\n*   **English Level:** 9/10\n    *   Based on the CV's clarity and detail, the candidate's English proficiency appears to be at least B2, if not higher.\n\nGiven the significant lack of direct experience in the core requirements (Facebook/TikTok advertising in the SEA region or children's edtech, managing large ad budgets, ROAS targets, and creative development), the overall score is heavily weighted towards the lower end.",
