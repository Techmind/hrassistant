  "reasoning": "Here's a breakdown of the CV's alignment with the Head of Product Growth (Monetization) role, along with scores for each requirement:\n\n*   **1. Growth Leadership (5+ years, track record of C1, ARPU, LTV improvement):**\n    *   The CV showcases 5 years of Product Management experience and mentions improvements in conversion rates (C1), user acquisition, and revenue. The candidate provides specific metrics such as 2-3x conversion rate improvement and 25% YoY user growth. However, it's not explicitly stated that they owned 'product growth' end-to-end. Some experiences lean more toward product management in general, rather than solely 'growth'.\n    *   Score: 7/10\n\n*   **2. Monetization Expertise (Optimizing funnels, revenue-generating tactics):**\n    *   The candidate demonstrates experience in optimizing landing pages, adding subscription models, and implementing UX improvements to increase conversion rates. They've worked on revenue generation in different contexts (ad-tech, SaaS platforms). However, the CV could be more explicit about 'monetization strategies' like pricing, packaging, or specific funnel optimization techniques.\n    *   Score: 7/10\n\n*   **3. Data-Driven Skills (SQL, Amplitude, Metabase):**\n    *   The CV explicitly mentions experience with data analysis, A/B testing, and web analytics tools (Google Analytics, Amplitude).  There is also an explicit mentioning of SQL, which aligns well. The candidate has used data to inform decisions and improve metrics. The CV could highlight experience with experimentation platforms or statistical analysis in more detail.\n    *   Score: 8/10\n\n*   **4. Team Leadership (Build and lead high-performing teams):**\n    *   The CV mentions 'Team Lead' roles and managing development teams.  However, it lacks direct evidence of building a 'product growth' focused team, or managing individuals specializing in growth and monetization.\n    *   Score: 5/10\n\n*   **5. Hands-On Execution:**\n    *   The CV demonstrates a willingness to be hands-on, with examples of implementing features, optimizing UX, and leading integrations. The candidate has a technical background and seems capable of contributing to execution.\n    *   Score: 9/10\n\n*   **6. Collaboration and Communication:**\n    *   The CV implicitly shows collaboration by mentioning stakeholder management, working with sales/finance/support, and leading integrations. However, it lacks concrete examples of cross-functional alignment across product, marketing, and engineering teams.\n    *   Score: 6/10\n\n*   **7. Ownership and Proactivity:**\n    *   The CV demonstrates ownership through examples of leading projects, implementing new features, and driving growth initiatives.  The candidate has a track record of taking initiative and delivering results.\n    *   Score: 8/10\n\n*   **8. AI Tools and Automation:**\n    *   The CV mentions \"AI\" and \"LLM\" in the skills section and a Generative AI course, but there is no concrete examples of using AI tools or automation to optimize workflows, accelerate experimentation, or enhance strategy development in the WORK EXPERIENCE section.\n    *   Score: 4/10\n\n*   **9. English Proficiency:**\n    *   The CV is written in fluent English.\n    *   Score: 10/10\n",
