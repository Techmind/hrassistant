  "reasoning": "The CV is for a Product Manager with a strong background in B2B SaaS, user acquisition, and conversion optimization. While the candidate has experience in growing user bases and improving conversion rates, there is no mention of experience in running advertising campaigns on Facebook/TikTok with a budget of over $50K, nor any experience in the SEA region or children's edtech, which is critical for this role. The CV does demonstrate an understanding of data analysis and A/B testing, but lacks the specific UA skills and experience in the required channels. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Relevant Experience:**\n    *   Running advertising campaigns on Facebook/TikTok in the SEA region or in children's edtech for over a year: **0/10** - No mention of this specific experience.\n    *   Understanding unit economics and work within strict KPIs: **5/10** - The candidate mentions experience in conversion optimization and revenue growth, indicating an understanding of KPIs, but does not explicitly mention unit economics.\n    *   Be able to accurately interpret analytics and draw conclusions from tested hypotheses based on data: **8/10** - The candidate has extensive experience in A/B testing and data-driven decision-making.\n    *   Methodically test hypotheses and improve business metrics: **8/10** - The candidate mentions various experiments and improvements based on user behavior and data analysis.\n    *   Be able to independently solve problems and act in situations of uncertainty: **7/10** - The candidate's experience as a product manager suggests the ability to solve problems independently, but it's not explicitly stated.\n    *   English at B2 level: Assuming this is met. **10/10**",
