  "reasoning": "Here's a breakdown of the CV's score against the job description:\n\n*   **Years of Experience (8/10):** The JD requires +3 years of product management experience in B2B environments. The CV indicates 5 years of product management experience and lists multiple B2B SaaS roles (C Teleport, Stat4market, SpacePush/Clickscloud), exceeding the requirement. The candidate also indicates having 10+ years of developer background which helps with technical discussions.\n*   **Technical Knowledge (9/10):** The JD seeks strong technical knowledge of web applications. The CV demonstrates a strong technical background with experience as a software developer and infrastructure team member, plus experience with APIs, databases, and various programming languages. His experience listed in 'Badoo/Bumble' shows experience with scalable services.\n*   **Strategic Thinking & Execution (8/10):** The JD emphasizes strategic thinking combined with hands-on execution. The CV provides examples of strategic initiatives (e.g., implementing debt control dashboards, credit line systems, subscription models) and quantifiable results (e.g., recovering 500k EUR of overdue debts, increasing revenue by 1%). This demonstrates both strategic thinking and a results-oriented approach.\n*   **Customer-First Mentality (8/10):** The JD requires a customer-first approach and understanding of user needs. The CV shows examples of user-centered improvements (e.g., removing the top reason for aircrew customer churn, optimizing landing pages based on user behavior).

The CV includes mention of stakeholder management, leading partner integrations, working cross-functionally, etc. I'd expect more concrete examples of collaboration and communication skills for a higher score.\n*   **Leading Cross-Functional Teams (7/10):** The JD requires the ability to lead cross-functional teams and drive initiatives at scale. The CV mentions leading teams and driving initiatives, but could benefit from more detail on team size and scope of initiatives. Revenviews is a good example, but lacks scale.\n*   **Agile Methodologies (8/10):** The JD specifies experience with agile development methodologies. The CV lists \"Agile Methodologies\" and \"Scrum\" under skills. While the candidate has indicated working in Agile environment, concrete examples when Agile practices where used and what impact did that made on processes are missing.\n*   **Creativity & Design (7/10):** The JD values creativity and an eye for design. The CV mentions UX improvements and redesign efforts. The candidate mentions working with hotjar, that indicates that candidate has experience with user-centered design. Lacking more clear design-focused outcomes.\n*   **Learning Ability (9/10):** The JD highlights the need to be smart, passionate, and quick to learn. The breadth of experiences across various companies and technologies (e.g., ad-tech, HR-tech, SaaS) and the certifications suggests a strong learning aptitude.\n*   **SaaS/B2B Background (9/10):** The \"Preferred Qualifications\" section mentions a background in SaaS and B2B products. The CV prominently features experience in several SaaS and B2B roles (C Teleport, Stat4market, SpacePush/Clickscloud, SmarterQueue), making this a strong match.\n*   **Product Management Methodologies (7/10):** The CV lacks explicit mentions of adapting/choosing methodologies to suit company size and goals.
