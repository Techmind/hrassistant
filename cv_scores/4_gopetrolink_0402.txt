However, the examples lack specific context related to financial or investment products, which are crucial for GoPetrolink.\n*   **Product Lifecycle Management (Score: 8/10):** The CV provides solid evidence of managing product lifecycles from concept to launch and beyond. The experience at C Teleport and Superjob.ru shows involvement in various stages, including implementation, optimization, and iteration based on customer feedback.\n*   **Cross-functional Collaboration (Score: 8/10):** The candidate has a proven track record of working with development, sales, marketing, and technical teams. The roles at C Teleport and Superjob.ru explicitly mention stakeholder management and cross-functional coordination.\n*   **Product Positioning & Messaging (Score: 6/10):** While the CV mentions improving conversion rates and user acquisition, it lacks specific examples of developing core positioning and messaging for products. The candidate needs to demonstrate how they've articulated product benefits and differentiators in the market, especially for a fintech/investment audience.\n*   **Market & Competitive Research (Score: 7/10):** The CV includes instances of market and competitor research, such as keyword analysis at Stat4market and competitor research at Superjob.ru. However, more emphasis on translating these insights into product decisions would strengthen this area.\n*   **Product Forecasting & Budget Management (Score: 4/10):** The CV doesn't provide clear evidence of developing product forecasts or managing associated budgets. This is a significant gap, as the job description requires managing budgets for development, marketing, and delivery efforts.\n*   **Sales Enablement (Score: 5/10):** The CV lacks explicit examples of equipping sales teams with training, materials, and tools to promote and sell the product. While there are mentions of marketing efforts, direct involvement in sales enablement is not evident.\n*   **Customer Focus (Score: 8/10):** The CV demonstrates a strong focus on customer needs and continuous improvement. Examples include removing churn reasons at C Teleport and implementing UX improvements based on user behavior analysis at Stat4market.\n*   **Innovation & Problem Solving (Score: 8/10):** The CV showcases a creative, solution-oriented approach to overcoming challenges. The implementation of debt control dashboards at C Teleport and the use of multi-armed bandit testing at SpacePush/Clickscloud are good examples of innovation.\n*   **Third-Party Partnerships (Score: 3/10):** The CV lacks specific examples of establishing strategic partnerships with third-party vendors or technology providers.\n*   **Web Development Familiarity (Score: 8/10):** With 10+ years of developer background mentioned, the candidate likely has a strong understanding of web development processes and cloud technologies.\n*   **Investment Services Understanding (Score: 3/10):** The CV lacks direct experience or knowledge of investment services, financial regulations, and compliance requirements.
