  "reasoning": "The candidate demonstrates a strong background in product management with experience in B2C and B2B environments, showcasing a track record of improving conversion rates, user acquisition, and revenue. However, the CV does not explicitly highlight experience in product *growth* and *monetization* leadership, specifically focusing on metrics like C1, ARPU, and LTV as stated in the JD. While the candidate has increased user acquisition and revenue, it's not clear if he's directly managed teams dedicated to growth. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n**1. Growth Leadership (5+ years exp, track record of C1, ARPU, LTV):**\n   - *Score: 5/10*. Candidate has 5+ years PM experience and improved conversion rates and user acquisition. However, there are no explicit mentions of managing product *growth* or implementing *monetization* strategies focused on C1, ARPU, and LTV. Improvements in debt recovery and LTV via subscriptions are related but not a primary focus for the role. There is no information on the scale of monetization efforts or revenue impact.\n\n**2. Monetization Expertise (Optimizing funnels, high-impact tactics):**\n   - *Score: 5/10*. The candidate shows experience optimizing landing pages and adding services. While he increased LTV with a subscription model, his direct experience with web funnels is not evident from CV alone. The CV does not contain any description of high-impact tactics or revenue-generating ideas related to mentioned funnels.\n\n**3. Data-Driven Skills (SQL, Amplitude, Metabase):**\n   - *Score: 7/10*. Candidate has experience in A/B testing, Amplitude dashboards, data analysis, and SQL. This demonstrates competency but does not explicitly mention a specific experience with all tools listed in the JD, notably Metabase. There is no specific experience in building experimentation strategies.\n\n**4. Team Leadership (Building and leading teams):**\n   - *Score: 4/10*. The candidate has been a team lead before and was a founding member in a startup, but did not specifically mention experience in building and managing *product growth and monetization* teams. There is a general lack of explicit mentions on people management experience.\n\n**5. Hands-On Execution (Individual contributor):**\n   - *Score: 8/10*. The CV clearly outlines a history of hands-on product management and execution. Experience in various product roles and contributions highlight a willingness to get hands dirty.\n\n**6. Collaboration and Communication (Cross-functional alignment):**\n   - *Score: 7/10*. Candidate's work experience shows coordination with cross-functional teams like sales and devops. The CV indicates good collaborative skills, though it's not explicit how he achieved product, marketing and engineering alignment. \n\n**7. Ownership and Proactivity (Delivering results):**\n  - *Score: 8/10*. The CV showcases a good track record of ownership and results in previous roles. The candidate appears to be a proactive individual based on his past achievements.\n\n**8. AI Tools and Automation (ChatGPT, MidJourney, AI-based data analysis):**\n   - *Score: 3/10*. The candidate lists 'AI' and 'ML' in skills, but the CV does not provide specific examples of leveraging AI tools for optimization, acceleration, or strategy development. The inclusion of 'Generative AI' cert is a small plus, but is too general.\n\n**9. English Proficiency (C1 or higher):**\n  - *Score: 9/10*. The CV is written in clear English and suggests good written skills. The candidate's location and work experience also indicate advanced verbal communication skills. No obvious red flags.\n\n**General Score Calculation:**\n The general score is calculated as an average of the sub-scores: (5 + 5 + 7 + 4 + 8 + 7 + 8 + 3 + 9) / 9 = 6.22\n\n**Final Note:** The candidate seems promising but does not fully satisfy all key requirements of the JD, especially in the areas of specific *growth leadership* and *monetization experience*. Additional information on his previous product growth experience, funnel development, and AI tool usage would be needed to increase his overall score.",
