  "reasoning": "Here's a breakdown of the CV's scoring against the Project Manager JD:\n\n*   **Responsibilities Match (9/10):** The CV demonstrates a strong understanding and experience in project management principles. Ilya has experience planning, executing, and overseeing projects, collaborating with teams, managing stakeholders, and driving improvements. The breadth of experience across different companies and project types is a plus. The score is slightly reduced due to lack of specific examples of 'overseeing projects' in the CV.\n*   **Agile Methodologies (8/10):** The CV explicitly mentions Agile and Scrum, indicating familiarity with these methodologies. However, it lacks detailed examples of using these methodologies in practice or specific experience with Kanban. Score lowered accordingly.\n*   **Communication and Interpersonal Skills (8/10):** The CV indirectly demonstrates communication and interpersonal skills through descriptions of stakeholder management, team leadership, and cross-functional coordination. Stronger examples of facilitation skills or conflict resolution would improve the score.\n*   **Project Management Experience (9/10):** Ilya has a proven ability to manage projects from start to finish, solve problems, and achieve goals, as evidenced by the various accomplishments listed under each role. The descriptions clearly indicate project ownership and results-oriented approach.\n*   **Process Optimization (8/10):** The CV provides multiple examples of analyzing and optimizing existing processes to improve efficiency and team performance, such as streamlining invoice processes, optimizing landing pages, and implementing UX improvements. These examples showcase a data-driven approach to process optimization.\n*   **Project Management Certification (0/10):** The CV does not mention any project management certifications (PMP, PRINCE2, AgilePM), which is a desired qualification according to the JD.\n*   **Tools (7/10):** The CV mentions JIRA, but doesn't mention Confluence, Slack, Miro, or presentation tools. The CV doesn't demonstrate advanced Jira skills (administrator level: including ScriptRunner, Automation, and workflows optimization) or BI applications, but does mention SQL.\n\n**Final General Score (6.5/10):** The average of the sub-scores reflects a candidate with solid project management experience, familiarity with Agile methodologies, and a proven track record of process optimization. The lack of project management certifications and some desired tools reduce the overall score. While the candidate doesn't perfectly align with every requirement, their experience makes them a viable candidate.",
