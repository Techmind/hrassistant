  "reasoning": "Here's a breakdown of the CV's score against the job description:\n\n*   **Years of Experience (8/10):** The candidate has 5 years as a Product Manager and 10+ years in software development. This exceeds the minimum requirement of +3 years in product management, particularly in B2B environments. The extensive experience warrants a strong score, although higher scores are reserved for candidates with significantly more PM experience.\n*   **Technical Knowledge (9/10):** The CV demonstrates a strong technical background, mentioning experience with web application development, databases, API integrations, and various programming languages. This aligns well with the requirement for understanding how web applications work and are deployed. The diversity of the technical skills is a significant strength.\n*   **Strategic Thinking & Execution (8/10):** The CV provides examples of strategic initiatives, such as leading user acquisition efforts, implementing new services based on market research, and optimizing product features based on data analysis. The candidate demonstrates the ability to both think strategically and execute effectively, although the examples could be more directly tied to large-scale strategic outcomes.\n*   **Customer-First Mentality (7/10):** The CV mentions optimizing landing pages, redesigning features based on user behavior, and addressing customer churn. These indicate a customer-focused approach. However, the description could be improved with more explicit statements and examples showcasing deep user empathy and understanding of pain points. I'm missing examples of user research.\n*   **Communication & Collaboration (7/10):** The CV mentions leading partner integrations and working with stakeholders. While this implies communication and collaboration skills, the CV doesn't explicitly highlight these skills or provide concrete examples of successful cross-functional teamwork and interpersonal skills. More specific examples would improve the score.\n*   **Leading Cross-Functional Teams (7/10):** The CV mentions managing stakeholder expectations. While this implies leadership, the CV could be strengthened by providing more concrete examples of leading cross-functional teams and driving initiatives at scale. The previous Team Lead experience suggests this capability, but it's not highlighted in the PM roles.\n*   **Agile Methodologies (8/10):** The CV mentions Agile and Scrum in the skills section. The description of implementing debt control dashboards to export accounting information to Sales/CS sounds agile. The experience in the ad-tech environment is also a good indicator.\n*   **Creativity & Design (6/10):** The CV mentions UX improvements and redesigns. While this indicates an eye for design and usability, the CV doesn't explicitly highlight creativity or provide examples of innovative design solutions. Examples of A/B tests suggest the candidate values usability.\n*   **Learning Agility (8/10):** The CV demonstrates the ability to learn new things quickly by highlighting experience in various industries and technologies. The certifications also demonstrates learning agility.",
