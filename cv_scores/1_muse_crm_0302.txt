  "reasoning": "The candidate's CV demonstrates strong experience in product management with a focus on growth and optimization, but there's a clear mismatch with the specific CRM focus required by the job description. The candidate excels in areas such as A/B testing, data analysis, and user acquisition, which are valuable but not directly related to the daily tasks of a CRM manager role. The CV highlights success in increasing user engagement and conversion rates using data-driven methods, which aligns with the 'Data-driven decision-making' aspect of the JD. However, the CV lacks explicit mentions of CRM tools like Bloomreach, or experience with push notifications, in-app alerts, and email marketing automation and building trigger chains, database segmentation mentioned in JD. While the candidate has experience with marketing tools and analytics, they are not CRM-specific, which is a significant gap. Additionally, while the candidate mentions experience with database management, it is unclear if this aligns with building and segmenting CRM databases. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the sub-scores:\n\n*   **CRM Strategy Development (3/10):** The CV lacks any direct experience in developing or implementing CRM strategies. The candidate has experience with product strategy, but not specific to CRM.\n*   **Backlog Management (7/10):** The candidate demonstrates strong skills in backlog management through project management experience and setting up task prioritization.\n*  **Hypothesis Testing and Project Management (8/10):** The CV demonstrates significant experience in hypothesis testing and project management. It includes a clear history of conducting A/B tests and managing projects from the ground up, aligning well with this requirement.\n*   **Campaign Management (2/10):** The candidate has managed campaigns and conducted user acquisition efforts but the CV lacks any mention about direct campaign management for CRM or email marketing. \n*   **Automation and Tool Implementation (3/10):** The candidate has implemented tools and automations related to product and analytics, but it lacks experience related to CRM tools like Bloomreach and customer data platforms as mentioned in the JD.\n*  **Data-driven decision-making (9/10):** The candidate demonstrates a strong skill set in data analysis and decision-making, with a focus on data-driven product development. It is mentioned numerous times in CV.\n*   **Required experience (5/10):** While the candidate has over 3+ years of experience with product management and marketing, the experience lacks CRM-specific focus and tools expertise (Bloomreach etc).\n*  **Familiarity with push notifications/in-app messages/etc (1/10):**  There is no mention of the required experience in CV.\n*  **Experience in building trigger chains and segmenting databases (2/10):**  There is no mention of the required experience in CV.\n*  **Experience with CDP (preferably Bloomreach) (0/10):**  There is no mention of the required experience in CV. \n* **English language proficiency (10/10):** The CV is clearly written in Upper-Intermediate or Higher English, and has native level grammar.",
