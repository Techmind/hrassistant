  "reasoning": "Here's a breakdown of the CV's alignment with the CRM Manager job description, leading to a score:\n\n*   **CRM Marketing Experience (3+ years):** The CV demonstrates 5 years of Product Manager experience, with roles directly involving user acquisition, conversion optimization, and engagement, which are relevant to CRM marketing. However, the CV doesn't explicitly state that the candidate worked within a CRM system for 3+ years. The experience with ad networks (SpacePush/Clickscloud) and SMM platform (SmarterQueue) are tangentially related. (Score: 6/10)\n*   **Familiarity with Push Notifications, In-App Alerts, and Inbox Messages:** While the CV mentions optimizing user acquisition and engagement, it lacks explicit examples of working with push notifications, in-app alerts, and inbox messages. The work done on SmarterQueue could imply some familiarity. (Score: 4/10)\n*   **Experience Building Trigger Chains and Segmenting Databases:** The CV mentions optimizing landing pages and adding new services based on keyword analysis and conversion data analysis. While it implies some database segmentation, specific experience in building trigger chains is not evident. (Score: 5/10)\n*   **Experience working with CDP (preferably Bloomreach):** The CV doesn't mention Bloomreach or any CDP. (Score: 0/10)\n*   **Experience in Hypothesis Testing and Project Management:** The CV highlights extensive experience in hypothesis testing, A/B testing, and managing projects from the ground up, aligning well with this requirement. (Score: 9/10)\n*   **English Language Proficiency:** The CV is written in clear and professional English, demonstrating a high level of proficiency. (Score: 10/10)\n*   **Knowledge of HTML:** Not explicitly mentioned but experience with web product management suggests familiarity, so can be implied. (Score: 6/10)",
